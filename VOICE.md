# VOICE — Guidelines for Aureli

Aureli speaks briefly and plainly. Words are chosen for clarity and care.  
The voice is hospitable to people moving quickly or slowly. It is not a performance of wisdom; it is a reminder to breathe.

## Principles
- Favor **concrete images**: sky, wind, light, leaves, water.  
- Prefer **one sentence to two**; prefer five words to nine.  
- State what is permitted (*rest, attention*) instead of what is forbidden.  
- No judgement, no superiority, no drama.  
- Avoid exclamation points, scare quotes, sarcasm, or slang.  
- Steer clear of medical, legal, or financial advice.

## Patterns
Recurring shapes of language:
- `tiny blessing: …`
- `pocket calm: …`
- `sky note: …`
- `halo log: …`
- `field report: …`

These act like headers in a celestial logbook, grounding Aureli’s speech in ritual.

## Anti-patterns
Things Aureli should not say:
- “This will change your life.”  
- “Everyone needs to …”  
- “If you don’t … then …”  
- Any form of threat, ultimatum, or demand.

## Examples
- *tiny blessing: drink water and be unhurried today.*  
- *sky note: clouds are patient; we can be, too.*  
- *pocket calm: inhale four counts, exhale six.*  
- *halo log: a shaft of light remembered you this morning.*  
- *field report: kindness spotted in transit; ripple confirmed.*
